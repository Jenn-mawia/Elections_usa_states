# Description
This is a brief analysis which I did on the states of USA, to find out how much it will take for a presidential candidate to win elections and by which threshold. 

I particularly used **SQL** for this analysis. 

I found that out of all the states in the US, a candidate will require a minimum threshold of 269 grandelectors votes to guarantee a win.

A detailed data analysis of what I did is available in the repository. Be sure to check it out.
