# Description
This is a brief analysis which I did on the states of USA, to find out how much it will take for a presidential candidate to win elections and by which threshold.  

Grand electors are attributed at the state level: in each of the 51 states, there is a given number of grand electors to win (roughly, but not exactly, proportional to the size of the state) and the presidential candidate receiving the most local votes wins ALL the Grand Electors in that state. Some states can be prioritized to increase return on investment of the campaign since the number of grand electors is not exactly proportional to the population. Assuming that there are only 2 candidates and no history (no trend of certain states to vote for a particular candidate ir party), each vote is considered equallt "expensive" but some states grant more grand electors per capita. 

I found that out of all the states in the US, a candidate will require a minimum threshold of 269 grandelectors votes to guarantee a win.

A detailed data analysis of what I did is available in the repository. Be sure to check it out.
